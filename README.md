# Login Registration Application

A complete backend application for user login and registration using Spring Boot including email verification links as a security measure. 

## Requirements ##

* Java 11+
* Spring Boot
* PostgreSQL

## Running the Project ##

1. Install all the required modules listed above and ensure everything is up to date.
2. Run the `DemoApplication.java` file and follow the prompts to register, receive a verification email, and enter the chatroom.

Multiple people can register as users connecting to the same server and chat among themselves.

## Future Contributions ##

An Admin has not been implemented, therefore further development is required to ensure people registering can be assigned as Admins and 
have complete access to add, remove, and monitor all users and their usage.
